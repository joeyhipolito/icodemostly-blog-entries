### Introduction
Developer tools, inspection tools, debugging tools or whatever you prefer to call this tool on whatever browser you are using has become part of every web developer's workflow, well in fact must be part of each developer's workflow. If you didn't  know this, damn, even I will sound hard on this, you are stupid, yes you are!

There's [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) dev tools, that started having their native complete dev tools just recently, and of course [we all thank firebug for all of this](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/10/firefox-developer-tools-and-firebug/), and there's [chrome native devtools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/), which I prefer using because of the following things I am going to discuss.

### Customization
I'm freakin' crazy about my tools and I always wanted a good feel on things I am using for development, so I googled up a bit and started customizing my [Chromium browser](http://www.chromium.org/).

If you are interested in trying it out and have a custom build , here is the repository

### Why Chrome DevTools?
One is because it is my by google, what else you can ask for. They have the best developers, and programmers.

There are a lot of features you can find in Google's Developer tools, and if you are not lazy reading you can check out the link above, if you are into watching videos, I can point you out to [Paul Irish's talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6qe_kVaBpg), that's the latest I think as of today(November 19, 2013), he discussed all sort of things I may not be able to discuss because I am too lazy.

### Workspaces
<blockquote>
Workspaces allow you to select custom directories in your file system which are always available for you to edit within the Sources panel. This can be one specific project directory or a directory that contains multiple different projects within it.
</blockquote>

Workspaces ftw! This one is a very cool feature that as of today I found the most interesting because it allows you to edit css, js and html **AND** or while it persist on your disk! It saves the file automatically, without you doing trial and error, and when you got what you wanted, copy the code on the inspector and paste on your css and save it then hit refresh which is pretty much uneffecient. 

#### Update (11/22/2013)
I forgot to explain how to enable workspaces in chrome (I use chromium)

* Enter chrome://flags
* Look for **Experimental Developer Tools experiments**
* Enable it
* Restart your browser

You should be able to see an **Experiments** on dev tools settings.

### That's it
If you are expecting me to have some kind of instructions on how to set things up, well I did expected it too, but I am too excited about posting this and I'm kinda lazy. But I hope this gave you a head start on what ahead of your dev path workflow.
