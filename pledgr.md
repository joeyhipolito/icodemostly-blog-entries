### Introduction?
We recently joined a hackathon sponsored by globe with a theme [It's all about APIs](/hackathon-its-all-about-apis/). Globe labs now provides sms,voice, and charging api, well honestly I have not listened to the whole introduction of the api, we started hacking already because we don't have much time for we are creating an app from scratch and not just trying to implement the api.

### What about?
We named our app **Pledgr**, can't think of a description about it, but it is an app that suggests things or activities you can do to help your community. For example there will be a fun run that supports a charity this weekend, the app will prompt you that there will be an activity like this. When you join in (*pledged*), you will receive detailed information about that activity, update you and so on.

### How did we do it?
The application is built using the tech I just learned during the hackathon, that is why I am the one to blame because the development went slow than expected. We used php to talk to the api, also we used it to serve the contents of the application from the database, we used javascript to talk to the server, layout things out and handle events.


### Conclusion
The idea is pretty neat, we did it in about 22 hours, but is still incomplete, Aaron told me that he'll continue the development of the application while I will be finishing some of my projects.

**P.S.** We won the competition, 4th place but score gap from the 1st wasn't that big, and because [Globe](www.globe.com.ph) is very generous, we also won 40 grands for the idea.
