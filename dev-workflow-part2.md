### Previously
Part 1, introduces some part of my work flow and I talked about setting up a decent CLI that will help us out on our development.

If you are quite unsure why we do those things, you can refer to google why is there a need to know CLI stuff. In my own perspective:
  
  * Manage things faster
  * Less memory usage, thus faster
  * Most programming utilities, dev tools are cli-based, 

This is very convenient especially to typist, that spends most of the time using a keyboard than mouse. 
Example:
Which is faster, typing `cd` or going to the 'user' directory of the current user:

On windows it's found in
`C:\Users\Owner`

And on linux machines
`\home\owner`

### Now
Now that you have set up your computer, to work using the terminal / cli, and assuming that I have 
somehow captured your interest towards the course, we can now proceed on getting your hands dirty and start using cli

I have mentioned earlier that there are thousands of way to open up the terminal, and I have presumed that you have made your own shortcut for it, for example

In my **windows machine**, I added console2 to my environment variables and when I pressed `win+r` and typed `t`, it'll launch my very own, customized terminal. (I will be talking about the customization in the future.)

### The Cheatsheet
Not because I did not need one does not mean I don't recommend using one, for beginners you can use it as your wallpaper so you won't have to go and visit google to ask what command for what.

{<1>}![CLI Commands](/content/images/2014/Mar/cli_commands.png)

You don't need to memorize all of those, all you need are the basics like

* directory traversal
* directory listing
* file manipulations
* file permissions
* ssh

Let me know if you have something important that I have missed.

### Also
Also, if you are working on a windows machine, there are few more things that you need to learn and I won't be able to discuss right now, because I have not been using my windows machine when programming, but I promise to update this post and include such discussions.

**On Ubuntu**

These commands are similar across osx and other linux and unix distributions, I really assume the readers have a really good grasp understanding the use of their terminal. People not using their terminal, please start using 'em.

### What's on my mind
I have few commands that I use everyday and I cannot promise that I can list them all here

`cd <path>` - allows you to traverse to the specified directory `<path>`

`mkdir <foldername>` - allows you to create a directory named `foldername`

The two above commands work across systems, but the later, well I am not really so sure.

`touch <filename.ext>` - creates a file named `filename` with file type of `ext`

`echo "some text in here" > file.txt` - allows you to insert `some text in here` in the file `file.txt`, using `>>` instead of `>` will append the text into the file.


### Oh well
Well, I am too lazy to discuss more stuff in here, I will point out that you cannot learn until you have tried and practiced it over and over, unless you are a super kena mega genius and talented person whom I hate so much, I envy them.
