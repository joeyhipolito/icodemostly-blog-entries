### Warning
This will be too long to read, but I ain't care about the reader, it's my record anyway.

### Okay.
First this ain't a tutorial but a record of my current development workflow including my ways of allowing my team mates to effectively collaborate with me.

### First things first
> **NOTE:**
I fvck don't care about how good this article was written or who'll be benefiting from this, this is just my record.
 
This is almost an introduction to allow readers to understand some things.

### Separation of Concerns (SOC)
I aint perfect and I cannot do all things in just one go. So I have identified the most classic separation of labor among my collaborators or team mates.

1. **Designer**
  * **Graphic artist**, someone who can draw/create our own resources
  * **Web designer**, commonly the graphic artist too, would be quite a trouble to find two person who can agree with the same design, he is responsible for the design layout.
  
2. **Frontend Developer**
  The one responsible for the frontend logic, commonly handling authentication on frontend side and other resources thrown from the backend if applicable, especially when dealing with single page applications.

3. **Backend Developer**
  The one responsible on receiving requests and returning response from the server. A person who have a greater knowledge on server side languages like php, java, ruby and now javascript using nodejs.
    
### Now
Now that you have a quite a good grasp on how things should be separated in terms of collaboration, well I assume you are a group of atleast two, or three, four is an overkill, I will have to discuss now a more technical aspect of my development flow


### Command Line Interface (CLI)
Although not a requirement, but for me it is, mastering *cli* will help you on your future development. Also, it really feels like you're a awesome, super cool, good programmer when you are using one.

{<1>}![Command Line](/content/images/2014/Mar/commandline.png)

**So to get started:**

* Install a CLI client of your choice but for me, I love using the default one (*I'm on **ubuntu***).

**Ubuntu**

Pressing `ctrl+alt+t` I guess would open it up for you. I don't exactly remember, just google it if it does not work on you. I mapped mine to `super+r`, you might as well mapped your own shortcut key. 

> *Prioritizing comfortability is the key.*

**Windows**
I've been on windows, and many of my friends uses it so I consider including some instruction to this article. But take not, I am not quite sure if it will work for you because it's been a while since I configure my windows to be used in my programming

{<2>}![Git](/content/images/2014/Mar/git_logo.png)

* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

The above applications are as far as I remember the things I needed when I get started on using a decent CLI for windows. Though I don't like the font of the default interface where the Git CLI opens, so I used a different console named: [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/). 

How? I can't exactly remember the steps but here is how I've done my configuration.

1. Added Console2 in my User Variables (perhaps you know how to do this)
2. Set console2 preferences to open Git by default

And I found this [question](http://superuser.com/a/458343) in SuperUser where you could get a hint to have a sweet configuration for your console2.

> **NOTE1:** I am not saying Git is your CLI or with any of that sort, but the installation of Git bundle includes a decent CLI for your windows machine and this is not the case for most linux, unix and osx systems, their cli is decent by default.

> **NOTE2:** Without a doubt, this will slow things down on your first weeks, because you are still learning quite a number of commands.
