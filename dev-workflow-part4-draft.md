### Today
Today, I will share some of the applications I use for project development, starting from editor up to... uhmmm, I don't know up to where.

#### Editors
I prefer [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) as my primary code editor, vim (installed along with Git on windows) as my fast editor and my [merge tool](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool). But I do recommend using full pledge IDEs like [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/) and [Webstorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). If you get hang of these ides, then great. I would love using one, but I care too much on speed.


#### NodeJS

Installing [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) does not mean you will all be developing javascripts. Today, the javascript community is growing at a very fast rate, the hell if you contradict me, I don't have statistics anyway, but the way I see it, it is growing fast. For this reason, tons of utility scripts have been created by generous developers in order to speed up any project development.

Like ruby where there is a very vibrant community that made package management super cool, NPM exists for NodeJS, where you can download tons of utilities and libraries to incorporate and help you on your application development.

In short, you need to install NodeJS, I just want you know why I am using it.
