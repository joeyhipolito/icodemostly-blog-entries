### Past
We just got the 7th place on the previous hackathon, jeez, too bad we weren't good enough to win that one, #practiceMore. 

### Persistence
I, [Aaron](http://nelonoel.com) and [Daryll](http://daryllsantos.com) are to join a hackathon again but we don't know if this will be a team play or not, but either case, Daryll won't be joining us this time, he got his reasons. It's our third time,  and somehow we want to win but most of all, we want  to learn, that includes determining the gap between our current knowledge and those who have experience and are working in the industry.

### What is this all about
Just finished reading the mechanics, it's all about implementing the new api of [Globe Labs](https://www.globelabs.com.ph), that includes the voice, sms and charging or payment api.

### Conclusion
I found the hackathon super interesting because I've been wanting to implement sms in my applications. There's [twilio](http://www.twilio.com/), there's [tropo](https://www.tropo.com/), but I haven't had the chance to create something out of it because of lack of motivation, and this hackathon is quite a  motivation to me.
