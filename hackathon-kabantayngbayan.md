### We are participating
 > Creative team names are too mainstream, we use **long and tagalog phrases** as team names. 

This is my 2nd time participating a hackathon and I am getting hyped and excited about this. I am with two super awesome people, [Aaron](http://nelonoel.com) and [Daryll](http://daryllsantos.com), again, and I guess will continue to attend competitions with them and might as well as build a startup with these two.

### When

Today, November 9, 2013, was actually the assigned date for this hackathon, but unluckily postponed due to bad weather. Philippines was hit by a super typhoon, Yolanda, and there is nothing the organizers can do about it but to move it to November 16 & 17.

### I'm too competitive, I'm scared.
Extended preparations are good, but not just to us, this extension is beneficial everyone, meaning the competition gets tougher, since the `api` is now out, brilliant ideas are on their way to development. Hope that no one ***#precodes***.
