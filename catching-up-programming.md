### What's the rant all about?
There are tons of resources everywhere and lots of open-source programs are scattered all over the internet waiting for you to access it and learn it. This article serves and introductory or description for my future post about what other things I use besides my usual technology stack, workflow and tools. Those articles will be all about new tech stacks and how to use or deal with 'em. Like this `ghost` blogging platform, I think it has just been 3 weeks since this kickstart project was released.

### Am I actually catching up?
It's a bit absurd to try to catch up with the current trend in programming. The world is learning programming, more and more people are into computers and technology these days because resources are everywhere.

#### Competition.
I don't really care if there are lots of people learning programming, but sometimes a fact crosses my mind, #competition. Whenever I thought of that, I constantly tell my self "Why do I care, when I do my best". Not all people do what I do, continuous learning and non-stop practice and research. 

### What, when, where, why how?
> You don't start catching up when you first did not consider where you started and what you already know.
