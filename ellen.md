### What is this all about?
So like how I blog as always, I will be talking on what the rant is all about, or what is Ellen in the first place.

Ellen, named after some super hot sexy chick in the Philippines who gained popularity during the friendster days and now a celebrity, is the name of the app we developed for roughly about 7 days of straight programming and research( researching because we are implementing new technologies we haven't touched before) for the [Philippine Commission on Women's](http://pcw.gov.ph) Mobile App Dev't Competition.

Okay the picture above is Ellen Adarna (so hot). And the following picture below is the splash screen of the app we have just developed. As you can see it's a girl too, but made to resemble my teammate's ([Aaron](http://nelonoel.com)) girlfriend, Kia, well that is what I presume.

### But that aside.
Aside from a hot chick and a teammate's girlfriend, our app is made with love using AngularJS and Firebase, that perhaps allow me to build it fast, also make it a real time app. And unfortunately, I'm still learning the NoSQL thingy that is why I have failed to structure the database in such a way that it would be very fast. Coming from a relational database background it would hurt my pride to create duplicates of keys everywhere, but that is not the case in NoSQL, [denormalization is a key](https://www.firebase.com/blog/2013-04-12-denormalizing-is-normal.html).

### What does our app do?
I consider our app is not so good app, because it's a q&a community with a bot(ellen) that gather her answer from questions answered by the community which gathered significant amount of upvotes, ideally.


### We won 3rd
I really have not expected this, because I even fail to trust myself for this, because having said that it is a community, it lacks too many things that a community should have, also, facebook, twitter, stackexchange would just make our app a copycat. Also, if we have won the first, it'll force us to continue on the development which I do not like because I cannot see what far beyond what I can do so that it'll hit the public.

### In either case.
In either case, I have learned and have re-assured myself that what I know now is far off from other students, what I use now comes at par with people in the field, in the industry, and lastly I have gained confindence that I am a better programmer. Hopefully that'll help me land a good job.
