### Why?

I'm pretty sure that I am not only the one who's very particular on choosing and setting up his/her machine. This matters to me, a lot! For a person who lacks focus, I need to optimize all the things I will be needing when programming, because a small or a quick lag on my workflow will significantly move me out of focus.

Over the past few days? weeks? or even months or years I have been testing and trying different setup for my pc(windows) so that I could achieve efficient programming. I came up with a list of things I should always be configuring during/when moving on other machine/devices or maybe when I buy a new machine.

### Overview

* shell > termial | command line
* ssh
* text editor

*will add more soon*

### Conclusion
This might seem stupid ending the article just like that, but I am not Paul Irish that can tackle things like that easily, I need to do separate articles for each. I will be entitling each topics with **workflow-\*** or **tooling-\***. 

### Disclaimer
I don't know if disclaimer is the right term for this one, it pretty much a note. This article might not be for your, its for me actually, for I am really forgetful and I wanted to have a record of what I do.
