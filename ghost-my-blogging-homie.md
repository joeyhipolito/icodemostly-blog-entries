### Why blog?
Blogging is my way of recording , taking down what I have learned, what I wanted to learn and what I should learn. This is also my way of keeping track of of the resources I found in the internet especially those repetitive tasks that I do when I jump from project to project or from a machine to another machine, sort of migrating stuffs, tooling, and workflow.

### What I use before
As most people use, wordpress ftw. Wordpress is indeed a good blogging platform but over the years, it became more like a cms, now its bloated with functionalities most bloggers won't use.


### Ghost!

Seriously, this blog platform is super awesome, although not quite friendly for most non-programmers, I found it super simple and easy to use, and the UI seems encouraging me to write some blogs. Ghost is super straightforward and allows you to do the nitty-gritty of blogging in just a few clicks. Over all this is just awesome.

### Technicalities
I would like to talk about ghost some more, but you can't just read it here: [Ghost's About](https://ghost.org/about/). Ghost is built using nodejs and sqlite, it's awesome that way, but the fact that I am short of money to host this thing in a vps or a dedicated server T_T, too bad. So I go over their githhub, look for some places where I can put this up and found [Redhat's Openshift](http://openshift.com), it was super easy to install because of [Corey](https://github.com/developercorey/). I haven't read about him, but looking at his repo tells me he works at redhat, so cool. You can find some quick install guide there.

Of course I could also deploy ghost using [Heroku](http://heroku.com), but I am too lazy and found openshift is  alot faster.

The downside of ghost, well, just in my part not for everyone else is that it runs on node, and I can't put it up on a shared server, waah, that's all.

And because I am lazy, I will definitely try to create something like ghost, but using php. I hope I won't be agains't their license. I hope.

### Conclusion
Overall the platform is cool. You can check out [HostGhost](http://hostghost.io), which works like [Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com), that is just a hunch. Just check out and be a beta tester, it requires a creditcard though, so I haven't tried it.
